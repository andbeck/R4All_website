      <description>We are pleased to announce the second edition of Getting Started with R Paperback at OUP,Amazon uk, Amazon.com, Amazon.de, Buch.ch
Electric version at Oxford Scholarship Online.
Now based on using RStudio Now based around dplyr and ggplot2 for data management and grahics New basic examples for regression, 1-way ANOVA and 2-way ANOVA A whole new chapter on the Generalised Linear Model That same Getting Started with R attitude. We got great feedback about our book &amp;ldquo;Getting Started with R, An Introduction for Biologists&amp;rdquo;, but realised over the last couple of years that we were using and teaching R very differently from what we wrote about back in 2010.</description>
